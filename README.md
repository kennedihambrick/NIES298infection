# Hambrick et al., in prep.
To explore the effects of temperature on the _M. aeruginosa_ host and Ma-LMM01 viral interaction two models were developed including a lytic population model and a resistant subpopulation model (Hambrick et al., in prep). All code for both of these models along with the corresponding data can be found in this repository.

**Lytic Population Model**
----------------------------
The lytic population model was used to approximate the host-phage interaction with an underlying assumption that all hosts are susceptible to the phage.



**Resistant Subpopulation Model**
----------------------------------
The resistant subpopulation model assumed the presence of a small initial subpopulation of resistant hosts to a given phage within a culture dominated by susceptible hosts.




**Installation**
